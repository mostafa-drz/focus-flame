Focusing is a fundamental skill for productivity and mindfulness. However, maintaining focus can be challenging in a world full of distractions. The ability to concentrate is not fixed—it can be strengthened through regular practice.

This project provides a simple visual focus exercise designed to be practiced for 5–10 minutes before engaging in deep work. Visual focus exercises like this can help train your mind to sustain attention over time. Pairing the exercise with calming audio is optional but can enhance the experience.

I hope you find this practice helpful in improving your focus.
